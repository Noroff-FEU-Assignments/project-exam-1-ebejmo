## Description

This is the GitHub repository for my Project Exam 1, Tree put.. a blog about golf courses. The goal was to apply the skills acquired during the first two years of my studies. The project involved creating a blog site, with design and topics chosen by myself. The main objective was to create a blog site that encompasses various design aspects and incorporates topics of personal interest. Three put... consists of several pages, including the home page, about page, list of blog posts, blog post specific pages, and contact page. 

#### Home Page  

The home page features a "Latest Posts" section with a carousel, allowing users to click and view more posts. On larger screens, users can see three posts at a time, and by clicking the right arrow, the next set of three posts is displayed. On mobile or smaller screens, the carousel displays one post and by clicking the right arrow the user can see the next blog post.

#### Blog Page

The blog posts page displays the first ten blog posts, and users can click a "Show More" button to reveal additional blog posts.

#### Blog Specific Page

Each blog post has its own specific page, which dynamically builds the content based on a query string parameter. The title of the specific page changes to match the blog post that has been clicked. Additionally, clicking on images within the blog post opens a modal that provides a larger view of the image. The modal can be closed by clicking outside the image.

#### Contact page

The contact page includes four textboxes for users to provide their name, email address, subject, and message content. JavaScript is used for validation, ensuring that the values entered meet specific requirements. If the requirements are not met, error messages are displayed to guide users in resolving any issues.
